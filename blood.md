# Abstain from blood

[Acts 15](https://biblehub.com/lsv/acts/15.htm) from verse 23 includes the following letter:  
> The apostles, and the elders, and the brothers,  
> To those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers, who [are] of the nations:  
> Greeting!  
> (...)  
> For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no more burden on you, except these necessary things:  
> to abstain from things offered to idols, and **blood**, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; keeping yourselves from which, you will do well.  
> Be strong!

The commandment quoted above is based on earlier direct commandments of the Lord God.

In [Genesis 9](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/genesis/9.htm) we read from verse 1 and then from verse 4:  
> So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them:  
> "(...) you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its **blood**."

In [Leviticus 17](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/leviticus/17.htm) we read from verse 1 and then from verse 10:  
> And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:  
> (...)  
> "‘And whatever man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who eats any **blood**, I will set My face against that person who eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people. For **the life of the flesh is in the blood**, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the **blood** that makes atonement for the soul.’ Therefore I said to the children of Israel, ‘No one among you shall eat **blood**, nor shall any stranger who dwells among you eat **blood**.’  
> Whatever man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who dwell among you, who hunts and catches any animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its **blood** and cover it with dust; for **it is the life of all flesh**. **Its blood sustains its life**. Therefore I said to the children of Israel, ‘You shall not eat the **blood** of any flesh, for the **life of all flesh is its blood**. Whoever eats it shall be cut off.’"
