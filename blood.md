# Abstain from blood

[Acts 15](https://biblehub.com/lsv/acts/15.htm) from verse 23 includes the following letter:  
> The apostles, and the elders, and the brothers,  
> To those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brothers, who [are] of the nations:  
> Greeting!  
> (...)  
> For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay no more burden on you, except these necessary things:  
> to **abstain from** things offered to idols, and **blood**, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; keeping yourselves from which, you will do well.  
> Be strong!

The commandment quoted above is based on earlier direct commandments of the Lord God.

In [Genesis 9](https://biblehub.com/nkjv/genesis/9.htm) we read from verse 1 and then from verse 4:  
> So God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them:  
> "(...) you shall not eat flesh with its **life**, that is, its **blood**."

In [Leviticus 17](https://biblehub.com/slt/leviticus/17.htm) we read from verse 1 and then from verse 10:  
> And Jehovah _(Lord)_ will speak to Moses, saying:  
> (...)  
> "And a man, a man from the house of Israel, and from the stranger sojourning in the midst of you, who shall eat any **blood**; and I gave my face against the **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_ eating the **blood**, and I cut it off from the midst of its people.  
> For the **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_ **of the flesh it is in the blood**.  
> And I gave it to you upon the altar to expiate for your **souls**: for the **blood** shall expiate for the **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_.  
> For this I said to the sons of Israel: 'Every **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_ from you shall eat no **blood**, and the stranger sojourning in the midst of you shall not eat **blood**. (...)  
> For the **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_ **of all flesh it is its blood in its soul**'.  
> And say to the sons of Israel: 'The **blood** of all flesh ye shall not eat, for the **soul** _(נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / ψυχή - psyche)_ **of all flesh it is its blood**: all eating it shall be cut off'."

In the above commandment the Lord (Jehovah) God exaplains the connection between the blood and the soul _(hebrew: נָ֫פֶשׁ - nephesh / greek: ψυχή - psyche)_.

What shall you do, if you are put under pressure to save your life (soul) by transfusion of blood or one of its main components (erythrocytes - red blood cells, leukocytes - white blood cells, or thrombocytes - platelets) ?

Pay attention to the words of Jesus Christ recorded in [Matthew 16:24-25](https://biblehub.com/godbey/matthew/16.htm):  
> Then said Jesus to his disciples:  
> "(...) For whosoever may wish to save his **soul** _(ψυχή - psyche)_ shall lose it;  
> and whosoever may lose his **soul** _(ψυχή - psyche)_ for my sake shall find it".

What shall you do, if it is expected from you to do a blood transfusion to someone?

Pay attention to the following words of apostles recorded in [Acts 5:29](https://biblehub.com/worrell/acts/5.htm):
> But Peter and the apostles, answering, said:  
> "It is proper to obey God rather than men".
